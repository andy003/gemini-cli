# Vim Mode

The Gemini CLI supports a robust Vim mode that emulates many standard Vim
commands for navigation and editing. This mode allows you to efficiently edit
your prompt and navigate through text without leaving the keyboard home row.

## Enabling Vim Mode

You can toggle Vim mode on and off using the `/vim` slash command:

```bash
/vim
```

Or you can enable it via the settings menu (`/settings`).
